# Reliability Models
A repository containing scripts related to reliability calculation

More specifically:

1. File MC_Reliability_TEST.m is a Matlab script that is used to estimate, using the Monte Carlo method, the reliability of a series and a parallel system.
2. File system_reliability_TEST.R is an R adaptation of the first Matlab script that tries to use Copulas for reliability estimation.
3. File bool_table_parallel_syst.R generates a boolean table for a parallel system.
4. File bool-table.Rdata is a boolean table of a system with 5 components.
5. File system_reliability_TEST.Rmd is a draft with the explanation of the rationale behind the work.
